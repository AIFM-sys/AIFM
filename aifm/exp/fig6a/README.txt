The goal of this experiment is to show that AIFM (NT) achieves performance close to the ideal local-only version.

First, execute run.sh in every subfolder. It sweeps the offered load from the low load to its max capacity, and generates a bunch of log files. Then execute parse.sh in every subfolder which parses log files and generates a summary file. The data points are shown in the summary file.
