The goal of this experiment is to draw a throughput-miss rate curve. AIFM achieves ~10 MOPS when the miss rate is close to 1, and achieves ~50 MOPS when the miss rate is close to 0.

The "run.sh" script sweeps the local memory size to get a wide range of miss rates. Each generated log file prints a throughput number and its corresponding miss rate.
