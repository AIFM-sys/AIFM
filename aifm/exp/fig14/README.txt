The goal of this experiment is to show our pauseless evacuator design achieves much lower latency compared with a stop-the-world (STW) evacuator design. You are expected to see the "STW" line to have large spikes while the "pauseless" line is fairly flat.

Execute "run_pauseless.sh" to get the "pauseless" line. Execute "run_stw.sh" to get the "STW" line. Each result line is the execution time (in microseconds) of an iteration.
