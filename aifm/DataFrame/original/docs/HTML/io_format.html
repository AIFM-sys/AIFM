        This specifies the I/O format for reading and writing to/from files, streams, etc.<BR>
        Currently only CSV format is supported. The CSV format is as follows:<BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>Any empty line or any line started with # will be ignored</LI>
          <LI>A data line has the following format:<BR>
            &lt;column name&gt;:&lt;number of data points&gt;:&lt;\&lt;type\&gt;&gt;:data,data,…<BR>
            An example line would look like this:<BR>
            price:1001:&lt;double&gt;:23.456,24.56,…</LI>
