        This static method generates a vector of sequential values of IndexType that
        could be fed directly to one of the load methods.<BR>
        The values are incremented by "increment".<BR>
        The index type must be incrementable.<BR>
        If by incrementing "start_value" by increment you would never reach
        "end_value", the behavior will be undefined.<BR>
        It returns a vector of IndexType values.
