 * The purpose of a #GBuffer is to keep the memory region that it holds
 * alive for as long as anyone holds a reference to the buffer.  When
 * the last reference count is dropped, the memory is released.
 *
 * A #GBuffer can come from many different origins that may have
 * different procedures for freeing the memory region.  Examples are
 * memory from g_malloc(), from memory slices, from a #GMappedFile or
 * memory from other allocators.
