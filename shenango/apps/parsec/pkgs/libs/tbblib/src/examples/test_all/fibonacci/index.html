<H2>Overview</H2>
This directory contains an example that computes Fibonacci numbers in several
different ways. The purpose of the example is to exercise every include file
and class in Threading Building Blocks.
Most of the computations are deliberately silly and not expected to
show any speedup on multiprocessors.
<H2>Files</H2>
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="Fibonacci.cpp">Fibonacci.cpp</A>
<DD>Source code for example.
<DT><A HREF="Makefile">Makefile</A>
<DD>Makefile for building example.
</DL>

<H2>To Build</H2>
General build directions can be found <A HREF=../../index.html#build>here</A>.

<H2>Usage</H2>
<DL>
<DT><TT>fibonacci <I>K</I> [<I>M</I>[:<I>N</I>]] [<I>R</I>]</TT>
<DD>Calculates the <I>K</I>-th fibonacci number.
    <I>M</I> and <I>N</I> are a range of numbers of threads to be used.
    <I>R</I> is the number of times to repeat the calculation.
<DT>To run a short version of this example, e.g., for use with Intel&reg; Threading Tools:
<DD>Build a <I>debug</I> version of the example
    (see the <A HREF=../../index.html#build>build directions</A>).
    <BR>Run it with a small fibonacci number and the desired number of threads, e.g., <TT>fibonacci 100 4</TT>.
