<H2>Overview</H2>
This directory contains a simple example that finds all solutions to a
Sudoku board. It uses a straightforward state-space search algorithm
that exhibits OR-parallelism.  It can be optionally run until it
obtains just the first solution. The point of the example is to teach
how to use the task_group interface.

<H2>To Build</H2>
General build directions can be found <A HREF=../../index.html#build>here</A>.
<P></P>

<H2>Usage</H2>
<DL>
<DT><TT>sudoku <I>inputfile</I> <I>N</I> <I>S</I> [<I>-p</I>]</TT>
<DD><I>N</I> is the number of threads to be used.
    <I>S</I> is the number of solutions to find: 1 finds the first, any other number will find all solutions.
    <I>-p</I> prints the first solution (optional argument)

<DT>To run a short version of this example, e.g., for use with Intel&reg; Threading Tools:
<DD>Build a <I>debug</I> version of the example
    (see the <A HREF=../../index.html#build>build directions</A>).
    <BR>Run it with a small problem size and the desired number of threads, e.g., <TT>sudoku input2 4</TT>.
