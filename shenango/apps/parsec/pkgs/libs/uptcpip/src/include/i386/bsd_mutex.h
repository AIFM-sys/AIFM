 * Simple assembly macros to get and release mutexes.
 *
 * Note: All of these macros accept a "flags" argument and are analoguous
 *	 to the mtx_lock_flags and mtx_unlock_flags general macros. If one
 *	 desires to not pass a flag, the value 0 may be passed as second
 *	 argument.
 *
 * XXX: We only have MTX_LOCK_SPIN and MTX_UNLOCK_SPIN for now, since that's
 *	all we use right now. We should add MTX_LOCK and MTX_UNLOCK (for sleep
 *	locks) in the near future, however.
