# This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components.
# Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must 
# also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these 
# modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own 
# system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components
# or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the
# default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an
# example).
# If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything,
# use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.
# 
# Locate osgText
# This module defines
# OSGTEXT_LIBRARY
# OSGTEXT_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to osgText
# OSGTEXT_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers
#
# $OSGDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$OSGDIR
# used in building osg.
#
# Created by Eric Wing.

# Header files are presumed to be included like
# #include <osg/PositionAttitudeTransform>
# #include <osgText/Text>

# Try the user's environment request before anything else.
