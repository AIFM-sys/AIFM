Description:

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method for simulating
fluid flows. This benchmark application computes one time-step of a liquid
simulation which solves the Navier-Stokes equations using SPH. The liquid is
represented by a collection of Newtonian particles which interact with each
other. These interactions are short-range which enables the use of a uniform
grid to accelerate the determination of which pairs of particles interact. After
computing the density of the fluid at each particles position, the acceleration
of each particle due to gravity, fluid pressure and fluid viscosity is computed. 
Next, collision detection is performed on six, axis-aligned planes (defining a
box) and collision response is done with the penalty method. Finally, numerical
time integration, using the Leapfrog method, calculates the new position and
velocity of each particle based on its acceleration.

About 90% of execution time is spent computing particle densities and forces,
about 7% is spent sorting particles into the uniform grid, and the remaining
time is spent handling collisions and performing time integration.

Parallelization:

The parallelization algorithm provided is based on spatial partitioning. As
mentioned above, particles are sorted spatially into a uniform grid which
covers the entire simulation domain. This grid is evenly partitioned along cell
boundaries using axis-aligned splitting planes to produce subgrids, one per
thread. Since particles which reside in adjacent cells may interact with each
other, multiple threads may need to update the cells which lie on sub-grid 
boundaries.

Each grid cell has a flag which indicates whether or not it lies on a subgrid
boundary. Whenever a particle in a boundary cell needs to be updated,
fine-grain locks are used for that update. Locks are not used when updating
particles away from boundaries since these updates will never occur
concurrently.
