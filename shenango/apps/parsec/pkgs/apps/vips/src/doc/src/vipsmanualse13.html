<!--l. 4--><p class="indent" >  This chapter explains how to write image processing
operations using the VIPS image I/O (input-output) system.
For background, you should probably take a look at <span 
class="cmsy-10">§</span><a 
href="vipsmanualse7.html#x13-360002.1">2.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:appl --></a>.
This is supposed to be a tutorial, if you need detailed
information on any particular function, use the on-line
UNIX manual pages.

  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x20-860003.1.1"></a>Why use VIPS?</h4>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >If you use the VIPS image I/O system, you get a number of
benefits:
    <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Threading</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">If your computer has more than one CPU,
    the VIPS I/O system will automatically split your
    image  processing  operation  into  separate  threads
    (provided you use PIO, see below). You should get
    an approximately linear speed-up as you add more
    CPUs.                                             </dd><dt class="description">
  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Pipelining</span>  </dt><dd 
class="description">Provided  you  use  PIO  (again,  see  below),
          VIPS can automatically join operations together. A
          sequence  of  image  processing  operations  will  all
          execute together, with image data flowing through
          the processing pipeline in small pieces. This makes
          it possible to perform complex processing on very
          large images with no need to worry about storage
          management.
          </dd><dt class="description">
  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Composition</span>  </dt><dd 
class="description">Because  VIPS  can  efficiently  compose
          image      processing      operations,      you      can
          implement your new operation in small, reusable,
          easy-to-understand pieces. VIPS already has a lot
          of these: many new operations can be implemented
          by simply composing existing operations.
          </dd><dt class="description">
  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Large files</span>  </dt><dd 
class="description">Provided  you  use  PIO  and  as  long  as  the
          underlying  OS  supports  large  files  (that  is,  files
          larger  than  2GB),  VIPS  operations  can  work  on
          files larger than can be addressed with 32 bits on a
          plain 32-bit machine. VIPS operations only see 32
          bit  addresses;  the  VIPS  I/O  system  transparently
          maps these to 64 bit operations for I/O. Large file
          support is included on most machines after about
          1998.
          </dd><dt class="description">
  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Abstraction</span>  </dt><dd 
class="description">VIPS   operations   see   only   arrays   of
          numbers in native format. Details of representation
          (big/little  endian,  VIPS/TIFF/JPEG  file  format,
          etc.) are hidden from you.
          </dd><dt class="description">
  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Interfaces</span>  </dt><dd 
class="description">Once   you   have   your   image   processing
          operation implemented, it automatically appears in
          all of the VIPS interfaces. VIPS comes with a GUI
          (<span 
class="pcrr7t-">nip2</span>), a UNIX command-line interface (<span 
class="pcrr7t-">vips</span>)
          and a C++ and Python API.
          </dd><dt class="description">
  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Portability</span>  </dt><dd 
class="description">VIPS operations can be compiled on most
          unixes, Mac OS X and Windows NT, 2000 and XP
          without modification. Mostly.
          </dd></dl>

<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >The I/O system supports three styles of input-output.
    <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Whole-image I/O (WIO)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">This   style   is   a   largely   a
    left-over  from  VIPS  6.x.  WIO  image-processing
    operations  have  all  of  the  input  image  given  to
    them  in  a  large  memory  array.  They  can  read
    any  of  the  input  pels  at  will  with  simple  pointer
    arithmetic.
    </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Partial-image I/O (PIO)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">In this style operations only
    have a small part of the input image available to
    them at any time. When PIO operations are joined
    together into a pipeline, images flow through them
    in small pieces, with all the operations in a pipeline
    executing at the same time.
    </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb7t-">In-place</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">The  third  style  allows  pels  to  be  read  and
    written  anywhere  in  the  image  at  any  time,  and
    is  used  by  the  VIPS  in-place  operations,  such
    as  <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">im_fastline()</span></span></span>.  You  should  only  use  it
    for  operations  which  would  just  be  impossibly
    inefficient  to  write  with  either  of  the  other  two
    styles.
    </dd></dl>
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >  WIO operations are easy to program, but slow and
inflexible when images become large. PIO operations are
harder to program, but scale well as images become larger,
and are automatically parallelized by the VIPS I/O
system.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >  If you can face it, and if your algorithm can be expressed
in this way, you should write your operations using PIO.
Whichever you choose, applications which call your
operation will see no difference, except in execution
speed.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >  If your image processing operation performs no
coordinate transformations, that is, if your output image is
the same size as your input image or images, and if
each output pixel depends only upon the pixel at the
corresponding position in the input images, then you
can use the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">im_wrapone()</span></span></span> and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">im_wrapmany()</span></span></span>
operations. These take a simple buffer-processing operation
supplied by you and wrap it up as a full-blown PIO
operation. See&#x00A0;<span
