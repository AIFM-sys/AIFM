VIPS SMP benchmark
------------------

This is adapted from the system used to generate images for POD:

  http://cima.ng-london.org.uk/~john/POD

Images from a 10k by 10k studio digital camera are colour processed, resized,
cropped and sharpened. 

This thing was originally processing images off a remote server over a 100mbit
network. No attempt was made to make it quick (there was no point): you 
could make it a lot faster very easily.

See

for results.
