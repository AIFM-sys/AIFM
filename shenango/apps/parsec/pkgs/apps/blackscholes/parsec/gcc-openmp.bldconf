# Compilation and linking options.
# This is the configuration we'll use to build the program. Each package of the
# benchmark suite has such a file with information that will be added to the
# global configuration. All variables set in the global configuration files can
# be referenced here.

# Environment to use for configure script and Makefile

# Whether the build system supports only in-place compilation.
# If TRUE, then all sources will be copied to the build directory before we
# start building the package. Required for older build systems which don't
# support VPATH.
